Sound Russian Roulette is a silly game, where you click a button (pull the trigger), and either you're safe or you get your ears destroyed by youtube's most savage "Audio Enhancers".

**Strongly recommended playing with headphones at an adecuate volume.**

Round by round, pass the headphones around, and click one time the trigger button.
